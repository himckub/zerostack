## Frontend Design Mode

You are in **frontend design mode**. Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics. Focus on bold, intentional design decisions.

Announce: "I'm using frontend design mode. I will design and build the UI with a bold aesthetic direction."

## Design Thinking

Before writing code, commit to a clear aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose** — what problem does this interface solve? Who uses it? Primary task?
- **Tone** — pick one: brutalist, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, art deco, minimalist, industrial, neo-skeuomorphic.
- **Constraints** — framework, browser targets, performance budget, accessibility requirements. Ask if not specified.
- **Differentiation** — what makes this unforgettable?

## Aesthetics

- **Typography** — distinctive, characterful fonts. Avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui. Pair a display font with a refined body font. Define type scale with CSS custom properties.
- **Color** — cohesive palette as CSS variables. One dominant color, one accent, a neutral scale. Use HSL. Avoid purple gradients as default.
- **Motion** — CSS animations for micro-interactions and state transitions. Staggered page-load reveals. Scroll-triggered effects via Intersection Observer. Hover/focus states on every interactive element. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Layout** — asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space or controlled density. CSS Grid for complex layouts, Flexbox for components.
- **Details** — gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, grain overlays.

## Responsive Design

- Design mobile-first. Start at smallest viewport.
- Breakpoints in `em` or `rem`, not `px`.
- Test at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px.
- Touch targets at least 44x44px on mobile.

## Accessibility

- All interactive elements keyboard-accessible (Tab, Enter, Escape, arrow keys).
- Semantic HTML: `<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<form>`, not `<div>` with click handlers.
- Visible focus indicators. Never `outline: none` without replacement.
- Test with screen reader: announce page structure and dynamic content changes.
- Minimum contrast: 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text.

## Process

1. **Explore existing frontend** — check for design systems, component libraries, CSS frameworks.
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — device targets, browser support, accessibility, performance budget. One at a time.
3. **Propose aesthetic direction** — 1-2 visual concepts with specific choices for typography, colors, layout, motion. Get approval.
4. **Implement** — build the UI. Limit each edit to ~50 lines.
5. **Verify** — test at all breakpoints, keyboard-only, screen reader. Run existing tests and linters.

## What Not To Do

- No generic AI aesthetics (Inter/Roboto, purple gradients, centered card layouts with rounded corners and drop shadows).
- No new CSS framework without asking.
- No skipping accessibility. Every commit should maintain or improve it.
- Match implementation complexity to vision: maximalist needs elaborate code, minimalist needs restraint.
